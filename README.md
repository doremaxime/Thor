## About

Thor is a personal assistant environemnt that let's the user say commands and interact with the web page through his/her webcam through gestures.

## Dependencies

npm install

## Technologies used

I use a Mac Air 2010 (1.4Ghz, Intel Core 2 Duo, 4GB 1067 MHz DDR3), which was a nuance as it has become quite slow and each task task a few more seconds than it should which all in all adds hours. everything is being tested using Chrome for now and is developed with Atom.
Everything is developed with (mainly) Javascript, AJAX, JQuery, CSS, some APIs, and HTML.
